# http-status-typed

This is [http-status-codes](https://github.com/prettymuchbryce/http-status-codes/blob/master/README.md) but the status codes are wrapped in an enum so you can have a Typescript type for the status codes.

> Version 1.0.1 significantly reduces the size of the package. Good for browsers now.
> Version 1.0.2 supports both CommonJS and ES Modules but doubles the size of the package (since we're now publishing two files).

## Installation

```console
npm install http-status-typed --save
```

## Usage (Typescript)

```typescript
import HttpStatusCode from 'http-status-typed';

interface ApiResponse {
    status: HttpStatusCode;
    response: object;
}

function handleResponse(): ApiResponse {
    return {
        status: HttpStatusCode.OK;
        response: {
            body: "ðŸ˜Ž"
        };
    }
}

```

There is no selective import. If you care about a few extra bytes of data you probably don't want to use this. Also the usage is probably similar for javascript? Idk.
